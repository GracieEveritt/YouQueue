## Project Description

We love sending media to our friends, but often these songs and videos get lost in long text chains. No longer! With this app, share YouTube content with a friend, and it will be added to their home feed and to a playlist of songs and videos just from you. Personalized messages can be included with each item shared. Users can modify their own playlists and favorite items they share or that have been shared with them.

## API

## Time Frame

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

Unless otherwise noted, time is listed in hours:
